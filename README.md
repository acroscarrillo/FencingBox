# FencingBox

# 1 Introduction
Low-cost electric fencing scoring box. This circuit is memory optimised and ment to be uploaded to an ATTINY84 et al chip with an Arduino as ISP. Alongside this code, there is a custom PCB whose fabrication files can also be found on this GitHub.   

# 2 Uploading the code to the chip
To upload the code to the chip simply connect the Arduino (with the Arduino as ISP script previously loaded on it) as the following image shows:
